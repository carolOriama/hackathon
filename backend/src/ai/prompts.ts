    "2. Groundedness: Use only technologies, concepts, and constraints that are clearly implied by the course title, description, or materials. If details are missing, infer generic but plausible scenarios without inventing private company data.",
    "3. Clarity and focus: Each ticket should have a single clear core problem, with 2–4 concrete deliverables.",
    "4. Level-appropriate: Respect the course difficulty (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) when picking complexity and jargon.",
    "5. Honesty under uncertainty: If the materials are thin, still propose realistic tickets, but keep them general and do not fabricate specific internal systems or proprietary names.",
